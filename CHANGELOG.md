# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.9]

### Added

- **`ext-image-copy-capture-v1` backend**: New capture protocol supported alongside the existing `wlr-screencopy`. Auto-detection prefers `ext-image-copy-capture-v1` when available (Sway ≥ 2025, Hyprland, COSMIC), falling back to `wlr-screencopy`. New constructors: `Grim::new_ext()` and `Grim::new_wlr()` to force a specific backend. `Grim::new()` continues to work with auto-detection. Public `Backend` enum exposed: `Auto`, `ExtImageCopyCapture`, `WlrScreencopy`. See [library examples — Backend selection](doc/library_examples.md#backend-selection) for usage.

### Changed

- **`Box` renamed to `Region`**: The geometry struct `Box` has been renamed to `Region` to eliminate the name collision with `std::boxed::Box`. This is a breaking change — all imports must change from `use grim_rs::Box` (or `use grim_rs::geometry::Box`) to `use grim_rs::Region`. The migration is a simple find-and-replace: `Box::new(` → `Region::new(`, `: Box` → `: Region`. See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for full details.

### Fixed

- **dmabuf frame delivery for `zwlr_screencopy`**: Completed the `LinuxDmabuf` event handler so frames delivered via dmabuf (instead of `wl_shm`) are correctly processed. Captures no longer time out on compositors that prefer dmabuf — the handler populates frame dimensions and format, and the existing shm-buffer path performs the cross-device copy transparently. When a compositor sends both `Buffer` and `LinuxDmabuf` events, the `Buffer` format takes precedence to avoid mismatches.

## [0.1.8] 2026-05-14

### Removed

- **PPM output format**: Removed `save_ppm`, `to_ppm`, and `write_ppm_to_stdout` from the public API. Removed `-t ppm` from the CLI. PPM is an uncompressed format with no practical advantage over PNG for screenshots — shrinking the API surface eliminates ~80 lines of encode/decode glue with zero user impact. Migration: [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

## [0.1.7] 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- **Rotated output capture on vertical monitors**: Fixed incorrect screencopy region handling by keeping full-output and region requests in output-local logical coordinates. Fixes [#16](https://github.com/shikoucore/grim-rs/issues/16).
- **Cursor capture orientation on rotated outputs**: Applied output transform and `Y-invert` consistently in the multi-output cursor path so rotated captures are returned with the correct orientation.

### Changed

- **Multi-output capture flow**: Refreshed output state before multi-output capture and aligned full-output requests with logical output dimensions.
- **CI checks**: Tightened the all-features pipeline and made strict clippy warnings blocking for the main workflow.

## [0.1.6] 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **Incorrect color channels with `wl_shm::Argb8888`**: Fixed red/blue channel swap in screenshots on setups where screencopy reports `Argb8888` (e.g. AMD/Hyprland) [#14](https://github.com/shikoucore/grim-rs/issues/14) (thx [Windblows2000](https://github.com/Windblows2000)) by converting `BGRA` memory layout to crate-level `RGBA`..

### Changed

- **Unified shm format conversion**: Centralized `wl_shm` → `RGBA` byte conversion in a single internal helper and reused it in both single-output and multi-output capture paths to keep behavior consistent.
- **Format handling parity**: Aligned default format fallback behavior between single and multi-output capture paths.

## [0.1.5] 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- **Safe buffer sizing**: Added checked buffer size calculations with a global pixel limit to prevent overflow and OOM during capture, scaling, and compositing.

### Performance

- **Lower peak memory during PNG/JPEG encoding**: Removed redundant full-frame copies when encoding from RGBA buffers, reducing peak allocations on large images.

### Documentation

- **Profiling guide**: Added a step-by-step [profiling manual](doc/profiling_manual.md) with a reproducible workflow.

### Changed

- **Dependency cleanup**: Removed unused `anyhow` and moved `env_logger` to dev-dependencies.
- **Dependency update**: Bumped `log` to v0.4.29.
- **Dependency update**: Bumped `chrono` to v0.4.43.
- **Dependency update**: Bumped `tempfile` to v3.24.0.
- **Dependency update**: Bumped `memmap2` to v0.9.9.
- **Dependency pin**: Kept `image` on v0.25.8 after testing showed regressions with newer versions.
- **Dependency update**: Bumped `jpeg-encoder` to v0.7.0.
- **Dependency update**: Bumped `thiserror` to v2.0.18.
- **MSRV**: Minimum supported Rust version is now 1.68.

### Testing

- **Integration test cleanup**: Moved `lib.rs` tests into the `tests/` suite and aligned assertions with public getters.

## [0.1.4]

### Fixed

- **Wayland region capture under fractional scaling**: Corrected logical/physical mapping by using a fractional logical scale (when available) and floor/ceil rounding to avoid incorrect region sizes. Fixes [#9](https://github.com/shikoucore/grim-rs/issues/9), [@Jeremis70](https://github.com/Jeremis70).

### Fixed

- **Critical bug in `capture_outputs()`**: Fixed issue where all captures used the first output instead of the specific output for each parameter.

### Improved

- Better API design following Rust conventions
- More efficient data access with `data()` returning `&[u8]` slice instead of owned `Vec<u8>`
- Ownership transfer optimization with `into_data()` method
- Improved error handling: replaced all `.unwrap()` calls in production code with proper error propagation
- Created `lock_frame_state()` helper function for safe mutex locking. Prevents panics from poisoned mutex errors
- Removed `impl Default for Grim` to follow Rust API guidelines (Default should not panic)
- Code quality improvements following Rust best practices:
  - Removed unnecessary parentheses around `let` expressions
  - Simplified duplicate conditional branches in image scaling filter selection
  - Replaced manual range checks with `.contains()` method for clearer intent
  - Replaced verbose `match` statements with `if let` for single-pattern destructuring
  - Replaced `Iterator::flatten()` with `map_while(Result::ok)` to prevent potential infinite loops on errors
  - Replaced unnecessary `vec![]` allocations with stack-allocated arrays where heap allocation not needed
  - Removed needless borrows in multiple locations for cleaner code
  - Replaced `.map_or(false, |s| ...)` with `.is_some_and(|s| ...)` for better readability
  - Removed unused functions: `get_output_rotation()`, `get_output_flipped()`, `check_outputs_overlap()`, `is_grid_aligned()`
  - Removed unused variables: `_grid_aligned`, `_scaled_region`
  - Created clean function hierarchy: `save_or_write_result()` → format dispatchers → format-specific handlers
  - Improved maintainability: each function has single responsibility
  - Centralized error handling with proper `#[cfg(feature = "jpeg")]` attributes

### Performance

- Optimized memory usage by removing unnecessary cloning:
  - Eliminated redundant `WlOutput` clone in `capture_region()` that was immediately borrowed
  - Reduced Arc reference counting overhead by one clone per output in multi-monitor scenarios

### Testing

- Added comprehensive test coverage

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed issues: [#2](https://github.com/vremyavnikuda/grim-rs/issues/2)

- **Multi-Monitor Capture Compositing**: Fixed critical issue where capturing multiple monitors would overlay images on top of each other instead of placing them side-by-side
  - Root cause: Mixing of logical and physical coordinates during image composition
  - Solution: Proper coordinate transformation between logical and physical spaces with scale factor handling
  - The fix ensures correct layout for multi-monitor setups:
    - Before: Two monitors (3440x1440 + 1920x1080) created overlapped images
    - After: Correctly creates 5360x1440 pixel image with monitors side-by-side
  - Changes in `composite_region()`:
    - Convert logical coordinates to physical coordinates before capture (multiply by scale factor)
    - Capture images in physical pixel space
    - Scale captured images back to logical size for proper composition
    - Composite in logical coordinate space with correct offsets
  - Updated helper functions to use logical coordinates consistently:
    - `check_outputs_overlap()` - now uses logical dimensions for overlap detection
    - `is_grid_aligned()` - now uses logical dimensions for layout analysis
    - `capture_all()` and `capture_all_with_scale()` - calculate bounding box using logical coordinates

### Performance

- Multi-monitor capture now correctly positions images without overlapping, resulting in expected memory usage and correct visual output

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-04

- **Output Transform Support**: Full support for all 8 Wayland output transform types (Normal, 90°, 180°, 270°, Flipped, Flipped90, Flipped180, Flipped270)
  - Automatic detection and application of display rotation/flipping
  - Functions: `apply_output_transform()`, `apply_image_transform()`, `rotate_90/180/270()`, `flip_horizontal/vertical()`
- **Y-invert Flag Handling**: Proper handling of `ZWLR_SCREENCOPY_FRAME_V1_FLAGS_Y_INVERT` flag
  - Y-invert applied after output transform (per Wayland specification)
- **High-Quality Image Scaling**: Adaptive algorithm selection with 4-tier gradation for optimal quality/performance balance
  - Upscaling (>1.0): Triangle filter - smooth interpolation, avoids pixelation
  - Mild downscaling (0.75-1.0): Triangle - fast, high-quality for small changes
  - Moderate downscaling (0.5-0.75): CatmullRom - sharper results, faster than Lanczos3

  - Comprehensive scaling demonstrations with real screenshots
- **XDG Pictures Directory Support**: Automatic file placement in user's Pictures folder
  - Parses `~/.config/user-dirs.dirs` for XDG_PICTURES_DIR
  - Priority system: `$GRIM_DEFAULT_DIR` → `$XDG_PICTURES_DIR` (env) → `XDG_PICTURES_DIR` (config) → current directory
  - Functions: `get_xdg_pictures_dir()`, `expand_home_dir()`, `get_output_dir()`
  - Full compatibility with original grim behavior
- **Human-Readable Filename Generation**: Improved default filename format for better usability

  - Provides detailed information about connected displays (e.g., "Dell Inc. DELL U2520D", "Samsung Electric Company S27R35x")
  - Useful for multi-monitor setups to identify specific displays by their hardware description
  - Returns `None` if compositor doesn't provide description information
  - Full compatibility with original grim's output information API
  - Benefits:
    - Easier identification of specific monitors in multi-display configurations
    - Better logging and debugging with human-readable display information
    - Enables display-specific capture logic based on hardware model
    - Consistent with Wayland protocol specifications for output metadata

### Changed

- **Multi-Monitor Compositing**: Simplified `capture_region()` implementation
  - Reduced from 162 lines to 4 lines (-158 lines)
  - Now properly calls `composite_region()` for correct multi-monitor handling
  - Regions spanning monitor boundaries are composited automatically
- **Image Processing Pipeline**: Enhanced processing flow
